# servantAPI 

is basically a follow through of or code replicas or practices with little modifiers of what can be found on the official haskell servant doc page - https://docs.servant.dev/en/stable/

Further things such as authentication and database connection are left out. They are concepts which I feel they are better tried out in my upcoming practice haskell project
